## Introduction

In this project, we backtest a cryptocurrency trading strategy on Bitcoin (BTC) against USDT (Tether) trading pair. The strategy involves using a combination of Moving Averages, MACD, and XO Trend indicators to generate buy and sell signals. The backtesting is done on historical price data retrieved from Binance API.

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- ta (Technical Analysis library for Python)
- binance (Binance API Python wrapper)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

bash:
pip install pandas numpy ta binance

## Usage
Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cryptocurrency-backtesting.git
cd cryptocurrency-backtesting

## Data
The historical price data for the BTCUSDT trading pair is obtained from the Binance API. The data includes timestamp, open, high, low, close prices, volume, and other relevant metrics.

## Technical Indicators
The trading strategy uses the following technical indicators:

## Moving Averages (150-day Simple Moving Average)
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
